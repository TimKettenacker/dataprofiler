reflects continuous fine-tuning for a data profiling / assessment task that is done onsite at the customer's

The reasoning behind having a data profiling is twofold: first, it aims at assessing the impact that unknown datasets may have on MDM matching components. At the beginning of any data-related project, you usually don't know what the data from your customer looks like.  Getting to know the data and its inherent quality is always crucial in an MDM project, as you are always at risk of loading in crappy data. On top of that, matching & deduplication software is usually sensitive to certain triggers that may appear in the data, for instance frequent occurrences of keyword tokens. Secondly, it helps raising the awareness of poorly managed data if the output of the tool is concise and reproducible. The customer is usually surprised about the shape of his data too, and such an activity changes the mindset.
